**A Radiosity Method For Non-Diffuse Environments**

# Abstract
- A general radiosity method is introduced
  - It solves for reflections of light among diffuse, non-diffuse, and emissive surfaces

# Introduction
- RT was the first method introduced to include shadowing and reflections from neighboring surfaces
- Given that a limited numbers of rays are traced from the eye
  - Perfect modeling of GI is impossible
- "Only radiosity methods can accurately model GI"

- The radiosity method is based on the Law of Conservation of Energy
- Is a complex global solution to solve for the intensity of light leaving all surfaces
  - Solves a set of linear eqs describing transfer of diffuse light between surfaces
  - Can be completed independently of wavelength
- Advantages
  - Increased accuracy of GI
  - Viewing independent

 - Problem:
   - Previously all radiosity methods assumed all surfaces to be perfect Lambertian
   - Specular surfaces were not allowed

 - This paper removes the restriction on surfaces by
   - generalizing the radiosity formulation
