**The Rendering Equation**

# Abstract
- A generalization of existing rendering algos
- Hierarchical sampling is a new form of variance reduction

# The rendering equation
- All previous rendering techniques are just approximations of a single equation
- All of these techniques were an attempt to model light scattering off of different types of surfaces (or volumes)
- The Rendering equation is:

    $$ I(x,x') = g(x,x') \left[ \epsilon(x,x') + 
    	\int_S \rho(x,x',x'') I(x',x'')dx'' \right ]
    $$

- $I(x,x')$ is the intensity of light from point $x'$ to $x$
- $g(x,x')$ is a "geometry" term
  - It is the catchall for modelling the effects of the local geometry at $x$
- $\epsilon(x,x')$ is "related" (what?) to the intensity of emmited light from $x'$ to $x$
- $\rho(x,x',x'')$ is related to the intensity of light scattered from $x''$ to $x$ by scattering at a patch of surface at $x'$
- I personally don't like any of the above notation

- The intensity of light from one surface point to another is simply the sum of
  - The emitted light
  - the total intensity scattered toward the latter point from the former

- All quantities in the equation are referred to as:
  - _unoccluded multipoint transport_ quantities
  - Computer Science and it's peerless ability to name things
- The integral is taken over $S = \cup S_i$
  - The union of all surfaces in the scene
  - the points $x$, $x'$, and $x''$ range over all the surfaces of all objects in the scene
  - This must also include a global background surface $S_0$
    - typically used for ambient lighting
  - This is a LOT of computation

- Maxwell's equations for only approximated
  1. Only model time averaged transport intensity (steady-state)
    - No phase modelling (again, steady-state)
    - Cannot accurately model diffraction
  2. Assume that the medium between surfaces is
    - homogeneous refractive index
    - Does not scatter light
  3. No Wavelength dependence
  4. No polarization dependence

- Assumption 1 is maintained for practically all renderers
- Assumption 2 must be removed to allow for many media affects
- Assumption 3 is all but gone in modern renderers
- Assumption 4 is maintained for practically all renderers

# Discussion of Transport Quantities

## Unoccluded two point transport
- $I(x,x')$ is the _unoccluded two point transport_
  - or, the _transport intensity_
- $I(x,x')$ is the energy of radiation per _unit time_ per _unit area of source_ per _unit area of target_

  $$ dE = I(x,x') dt dx dx' $$

- The units of $I$ are $\frac{joule}{m^4 sec}$

## Geometry term
- $g(x,x')$ is the _geometry term_
- It encodes the occlusion of surface points by other surface points
  - Specifically occlusion from $x'$ to $x$
- Visibility between $x$ and $x'$
  - Mutually not visible (occluded): $g(x,x') = 0$
  - Mutulally visible: $g(x,x') = 1/r^2$ where $r = length(x - x')$

## Emittance term
- $\epsilon (x,x')$ is the _unoccluded two point transport emittance_
- measures the energy emitted by a surface at $x'$ reaching point $x$
- $\epsilon (x,x')$ is the energy per _unit time_ per _unit area of source_ per _unit area of target_

  $$ dE = \frac{1}{r^2} \epsilon(x,x') dt dx dx' $$

- the units of $\epsilon (x,x')$ are $\frac{joule}{m^2 sec}$

## Scattering term
- $\rho(x,x',x'')$ is the _unoccluded three point transport reflectance_
- is the intensity of energy scattered by a surface at x' originating from x'', terminating at a surface element at x
- This term would also encompase transmittance, but is removed for simplicity
- This represents the totality of indirect light
  - I don't know if an x''', x'''', etc. is necessary for complete info
- $\rho(x,x',x'')$ represents a percentage, and so is unitless

  $$ dE = \frac{1}{r^2} \rho(x,x',x'') I(x',x'') dt dx dx' dx'' $$

## More conventional radiometric quantities
- Ordinary radiometric instensity is defined as energy per _unit time_ per _unit of projected area of source_ per _solid angle_

  $$ dE = i(\theta ',\phi ') d\omega d x'_p dt $$


The terms of radiometric intensity can be related to the rendering equation by

- $r = ||x - x'||$
- $dx'_p = dx' \cos(\theta)$
- $\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{r}(n \cdot (x-x'))$
- $\cos(\theta') = \frac{1}{r}(n' \cdot (x-x'))$
- $\cos(\phi') = \frac{1}{r}(t' \cdot (x-x'))$
- where $n$ is the normal at $x$
- where $t$ is the tangent at $x$
- where $\theta$ is the theta at $x$
- where $\phi$ is the phi at $x$

The solid angle subtended by surface element $dx$ is the fractional area of a sphere of radius $r$ taken up by the projected area $dx_p = dx \cos(\theta)$

  $$ d\omega = \frac{dx_p}{r^2} = \frac{1}{r^2} \cos \theta dx $$

Combining the two previous equations leads to:

  $$ dE = i(\theta ',\phi ') \frac{1}{r^2} \cos \theta \cos \theta ' dt dx dx' $$

## Relating old terms with new terms
- The relationship between transport intensity and ordinary intensity is found by

  $$ I(x,x') = i(\theta', \phi') \frac{1}{r'^2} \cos \theta \cos \theta' $$

- Transport emittance and ordinary emittance:

  $$ \epsilon(x,x') = \epsilon(\theta', \phi') \cos \theta \cos 
  \theta ' $$

- Transport reflectance and ordinary radiometric total bidirectional reflectance function $\rho(\theta', \phi', \psi', \sigma')$

  $$ i(\theta ', \phi ') = \rho(\theta ', \phi ', \psi ', \sigma ') i(\psi ', \omega ') d\omega '' \cos \psi' $$

- where $\theta '$ is the angle between $n'$ and $x' - x$
- where $\phi '$ is the angle between $t'$ and $x' - x$
- where $\psi '$ is the angle between $n'$ and $x'' - x'$
- where $\sigma '$ is the angle between $t'$ and $x'' - x'$

- Unoccluded three point transport reflectances and ordinary total bidirectional reflectance

  $$ \rho (x,x',x'') = \rho(\theta ', \phi ', \psi ', \sigma ') \cos \theta \cos \theta '$$ 

# Methods for approximate solution
- A wide variety of previous rendering algorithms can be viewed as approximations of the rendering equation

## Neumann series

  $$ I = g \epsilon + g M I $$

- $M$ is the linear operator given by the intgeral term in TRE
- The above can be rearranged as

  $$ (1 - g M)I = g \epsilon $$

- $1$ is the identity operator
- The equation can be inverted to

  $$ I = (1- gM)^{-1} g \epsilon
       = g \epsilon + gMg \epsilon + gMgMg \epsilon + g(Mg)^3 \epsilon ...
  $$

- In order for the above sum to converge
  - The spectral rasius of M must be less than 1
- The Neumann expansion gives a final intensity of radiation transfer between points $x$ and $x'$ as the sum of:
  - A direct term
  - A once scattered term
  - A twice scattered term
  - etc.

## The Utah approximation

  $$ I = g \epsilon + gM \epsilon_0 $$

- The Utah approximation only computes the first bounce
- $M$ operates directly on $\epsilon_0$
  - This means that visiblity to emitters is ignored
  - It ignored shadows
- $\epsilon_0$ is used to denote that only point lights are supported
- $M$ becomes a simple sum over light sources
  - As opposed to an integration over $x''$

- Later implementations would add shadows and extended light sources

## The Ray Tracing approximation
- Whitted proposed

  $$ I = g\epsilon + gM_0 g\epsilon_0 + gM_0 gM_0 g\epsilon_0 + ... $$

- $M_0$ is the scattering model which is the sum of
  - Reflection $\delta$ function
  - Refraction $\delta$ function
  - diffuse $\cos$ function
- Note that Whitted has $g\epsilon_0$, which means that:
  - he has shadows, but
  - All lights are point radiators
- Whitted's ambient term corresponds to the initial $\epsilon$ term

## The distributed ray tracing approximation
- The same as Whitted Proposal, with the following mutations
  1. Refraction is now a cosine term around the $\delta$
  2. Reflection is now a cosine term around the $\delta$
- The refraction and reflection parts of the $M$ term are approximated with Monte Carlo techniques
- The ambient term is unchanged
- The diffuse term is unchanged

## The radiosity approximation
- New rendering technique for perfectly diffuse surfaces

  $$ \rho(\theta ', \phi ', \psi ', \sigma ') = \rho_0 $$

- The _radiosity_ $B(x')$ of a surface element $dx'$ is the energy flux over the visible hemisphere
- Energy prt _unit time_ per _unit (unprojected) area_
- Measured in watts per meter squared

  $$ dB(x') = dx' \int_{hemi} i(\theta ',\phi ') \cos \theta 'd\omega $$
  $$ = dx' \int_{hemi} \frac{I(x, x') r^2}{\cos \theta} d\omega $$
  $$ = dx' \int_{S} I(x, x') dx $$

- For the hemispherical quantities we can integrate over all the surfaces in the scen

  $$ dB(x') = dx' \int \left[ g(x,x') \epsilon(x,x') + 
      g(x,x') \int \rho(x,x',x'') I(x',x'')dx'' \right] dx $$

  $$ dB(x') = dB_e(x') + dB_r(x') $$


Solving for the Emittance term $dB_e(x')$

- If there is an occlusion between $x$ and $x'$, $g(x,x') = 0$, and

  $$ dB_e(x') = 0 $$

- If there is no occlusion between $x$ and $x'$, $g(x,x') = \frac{1}{r^2}$

  $$ dB_e(x') = dx' \int \frac{\epsilon (x,x')}{r^2} dx $$
  $$ = dx' \int \frac{\epsilon (\theta ', \phi ') \cos \theta ' \cos \theta}{r^2} dx $$
  $$ = dx' \int \epsilon (\theta ', \phi ') \cos \theta ' d \omega $$
  $$ = dx' \pi \epsilon_0 $$

- where $\epsilon_0$ is the hemispherical emittance of the surface element $dx'$

Solving for the reflectance term

- If there is an occlusion between $x$ and $x'$, $g(x,x') = 0$, and

  $$ dB_r(x') = 0 $$

- If there is no occlusion between $x$ and $x'$, $g(x,x') = \frac{1}{r^2}$

  $$ dB_r(x') = dx' \int \frac{1}{r^2} \int \rho (x,x',x'') I(x',x'') dx''dx $$
  $$ = dx' \int \frac{1}{r^2} \rho(\theta', \phi', \psi', \sigma') \cos \theta \cos \theta 'dx \int  I(x',x'') dx'' $$
  $$ = dx' \rho_0 \int \cos \theta d\omega \int I(x',x'') dx'' $$
  $$ = dx' \rho_0 \pi H(x') $$

- $H(x')$ is the hemispherical incident energy per unit time and unit area

In total,

  $$ dB(x') = \pi [ \epsilon_0 + \rho_0 H(x') ] dx' $$

# Markov chains for solving integral equations
- Markov chains are a numerical method for solving integral equations

## Finite dimensional version

- For an equation

 $$ x = a + Mx $$

- where $x$ and $a$ are $n$-dimensional vectors
- $M$ is an $n \times n$ matrix
- and $x$ is our unknown

- With a Neumann expansion, for a matrix $M$
  - with eigenvalues within the unit circle:


  $$ x = a + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} M^k a $$

- $x$ is found by averaging over paths through matrix multiples

## infinite dimensional version

# Hierarchical sampling
- The field of variance reduction extends beyond Ray Tracing
  - Any variance reduction technique will have utility in any Monte Carlo
- All techniques are inspired by stratified sampling

## Sequential uniform sampling
- Samples of an integral estimate are repeatedly collected until the variance falls below some threshold
- This can be used to prioritize rays in the direction of difficult portions
- This strategy is not compatible with stratifying the samples

- The jitter sampling method
  1. Splits a pixel into n cells (strata)
  2. Gives each cell 1 random sample within that cell
- Uniform subdivision is impossible w/o _a priori_ knowledge of sample count

- _Sequential uniform sampling_ enables uniform subdivision w/o _a priori_ knowledge
- This is accomplished according to the folowing:
  1. We have a tree of sample points
  2. Traverse the tree until a leaf cell is found
  3. The cell is split in half
  4. The existing sample is placed in it's half of the cell
  5. Choose a new sample from the empty half

- In order to perform a uniform search of the space
  - It is necessary to split cells (nodes) breadth first in random order
- To choose a node, follow this algo:
  1. If either is a leaf, choose that leaf
  2. Choose left  if level(left) < level(right) and left is balanced
  3. Choose right if level(right) < level(left) and right is balanced
  4. Choose randomly otherwise
  
## The multidimensional case
- The above is extended to higher dimensions than 1D using a k-d tree
- Succesively subdivide the n-space into two halves going through succesive axes
  - e.g. x, y, z, w, x, y, z, w, ...

## Hierarchical integration
- Take into account the volume (area) of a cell
- Each time a leaf cell is split
  - That cell's contribution to the sum is halved
- Converges in $O(n^-1)$ as opposed to $O(n^-2)$ for monte carlo

## Adaptive hierarchial integration
- Focus samples on "interesting" parts of the tree
  - demur samples where the integrand is nearly constant
- Examples
  - randomly choose a subnode
  - uniform sampling threshold
  - variance
  - time history of the integral
- This is hard, and was not completed

## Nonuniform sampling: Importance sampling analogs
- Is importance sampling

# Application to the rendering equation
- Sequential uniform sampling is used for depth of field
- They don't flatten the tree, so the median of a pixel can be found through Binary search

- The difference between whitted and this is
  - Whitted has a tree of rays from surfaces, this has only one path

- The first bounce and the first ray are **the most imortant** when
  - solving for variance
  - determining path contribution
- Second rays contribute much less to variance
- Whitted RT blows most of it's compute on successive bounces

- Having fewer bounces per ray is, in general, a more optimized approach

- **Holy Shit** 
  - "However, for this new fast form of ray tracing--called _path tracing_..."
  - I think this is where the term came from
