An Improved Illumination Model for Shaded Display
Turner Whitted

# Abstract
- Use of term _Global Illumination_
  - I think GI here means both _Direct Illumination_ and _Indirect Illumination_
- Outlines a _tree_ of rays from the viewer into the scene
- Anti-Aliasing is included
- Polygonal and curves surfaces are supported

# Introduction

- The illumination model exists to determine quantity of light reflected to the viewer from a point on a surface. This is a function of:
  1. Light source direction 
  2. Light source strength 
  3. Viewer position
  4. Surface orientation
  5. Surface properties
- Shading calculations can be performed on three scales
  1. microscopic
  2. local
  3. global
- Previous shaders used aggregate of local data, i.e. light source and surface info
- The Whitted model uses global info to calculate intensities
- The shading algorithm is then rewritten for the change

# Conventional Models
Conventional _for the time_

## Simplest Model
- Based on Lambert's cosine law:

    $$ I = k_d \sum_{j=1}^{j=l_s}
        (\overrightarrow{N} \cdot \overrightarrow{L_{j}}) 
    $$
    
## Phong's shading model
- Combination of an ambient, diffuse, and specular term
- Assumes that every light source is infinitely distant from the objects in the scene
- Breaks down for emmissive objects in the scne
- Breaks down for light reflecting from object to object
- Enables realistic-enough diffuse reflection, but very poor specular reflections

    $$ I = I_a + k_d \sum_{j=1}^{j=l_s}
        (\overrightarrow{N} \cdot \overrightarrow{L_{j}}) 
        + k_s \sum_{j=1}^{j=l_s}
        (\overrightarrow{N} \cdot \overrightarrow{L_{j}})^n
    $$

- $I$ = reflected intensity
- $I_a$ = reflection due to ambient light
- $k_d$ = diffuse reflection coefficient
- $\overrightarrow{N}$ = unit surface normal
- $\overrightarrow{L_j}$ = the vector in the direction of the jth light source
- $k_s$ = the specular reflection coefficient
- $\overrightarrow{H_j}$ = the half-way ector between the viewer and the jth light source
- $n$ = an exponent that depends on the glossiness of the surface

## Blinn and Newell
- Partially solves Phong's specular reflection problem
- Models an object's environment (per object!)
- Maps GI per object onto a sphere of infinite radius
- Greatly enhanced realism
- HUGELY computationally expensive

## Shadow Modeling
- A point on a surface is _in shadow_ if it
  - is visible to the viewer
  - but **not** visible to the light source
- Prior methods invoked the visibility algo twice per surface point
  1. Visibility to viewer
  2. Visibility to the light source

## Transmission of light through transparent objects
- Requires rendering from back to front
- Does not model refraction

# Improved Model

## Math Model
-  Including a transmissive term:

    $$ I = I_a + k_d \sum_{j=1}^{j=l_s}
        (\overrightarrow{N} \cdot \overrightarrow{L_{j}}) 
        + k_s S + k_l T
    $$

- From a viewpoint $\overrightarrow{V}$ $S$ and $T$ represent
  - $S$ represents the specular reflection from radiance at $reflect(V,N)$
  - $T$ represents the transmissive radiance from $refract(P,\eta_i, \eta_o)$
- From this equation, $k_s$ and $k_l$ are held constant, but, in reality:
  - $k_s(\theta)$ and $k_l(\theta)$
  - Where both are defined by the Fresnel equations
  - They can be approximated by the Schlick Fresnel approximation

- Reflection is defined

    $$ \overrightarrow{V'} = \frac{\overrightarrow{V}}
        {| \overrightarrow{V} \cdot \overrightarrow{N} |}
    $$

    $$ \overrightarrow{R} = \overrightarrow{V'} + 2 \overrightarrow{N} $$

- Refraction is defined
    $$ k_f = ({k_n}^2|\overrightarrow{V'}|^2 - 
        |\overrightarrow{V'} + \overrightarrow{N}|^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}
    $$

    $$ \overrightarrow{P} = k_f (\overrightarrow{N} + \overrightarrow{V'}) 
         - \overrightarrow{N} 
    $$

- $k_n = \eta_o / \eta_i$
- where $k_f$ is a complex number, it is assumed to be zero
  - This would follow from total internal reflection

## Small Implementation Details
- This paper does _not_ provide a solution to the problem of microfacets
  - It doesn't specify how exactly rough specular reflection is calculated
  - Rather, it punts: For rough objects, it reverts to the Phong shading model
- Shadow casting only reduces the diffuse term
- The intensity of a path is _Wild_. For every path trace:
  1. A Tree of transmission and reflection is created
  2. The Math model above is applied to solve for intensity of all leaves of the tree
  3. The intensity of all leaves is attenuated by a linear function of a leaf's distance to it's parent
    1. _WHAT_.
    2. Know-a-days We don't attenuate the intensity of successive bounces, rather, we just take it's product.
    3. Furthermore, if we were to attenuate, a square-law attenuation is common-sense
    4. But, the Monte Carlo solution is _already_ attenuating according to square-law.
    5. The linear function is a fudge to deal with non-planar surfaces or non-point lighting
  4. The algorithm recurses until the true intensity is calculated for the root node (pixel)

# Visible Surface Processor
- The obvious solution is to trace light rays from the lights until they intersect the viewer
  - This is incredibly wasteful

## Smarter Visibility
- The smarter solution is to trace from the viewer, toward the objects in the scene
- Visibility calculations do not end with the closesthit intersection of ray and object
- For every intersection, additional rays are created:
  - "more rays" in the $R$ direction (reflection)
  - "more rays" in the $P$ direction (transmission)
  - "more rays" in the $L_i$ direction (toward each light)
  - It isn't clear if multiple rays are sent for each of $R$, $P$, or $L_i$ directions
- This is repeated (creating a tree) until no new rays intersects any object
  - Fuck that is expensive

## Abandoned Traditional Notions
- The "measure" of visual complexity is larger than convention
  - Objects may be visible through reflections in other objects
- The following can cause inaccuracies
  - Culling of objects behind other objects
  - Clipping
  - Backface culling

## Bounding Volume
- The description for an object includes a bounding volume
- if the ray does not intersect the volume, the object can be safely eliminated
- Spheres are used as the bounding volume for _all_ objects

- Spheres are used as test objects because bounding volume == object volume
- Objects that are not spheres require an additional process to determine intersection
- Polygonal surfaces:
  1. Finds point on surface
  2. Checks for interior of surface
- Bicubic patches. This sceme is simple, it is _not_ efficient:
  1. Bounding spheres are generated for each patch
  2. If one of the bounding spheres is pierced
  3. The patch is subdivided using Catmull-Clark
  4. Subdivision is repeated until either
    - No bounding spheres are intersected
    - The intersected bounding sphere is smaller than a predetermined minimum

## Catmull-Clark (from Wikipedia)
The algorithm is defined as:
1. For each face, add a _face point_
  - Set each face point to the average of all points for the face
2. For each edge, add an _edge point_
  - Set each edge point to the average of the 2 endpoints, and 2 adjacent facepoints
3. For each face point, add an edge to each edge point for the face
4. For each original point $P$
  1. Take the average $F$ of all $n$ face points touching $P$
  2. Take the average $R$ of all $n$ edge midpoints for (original) edges touching $P$
    - the edge midpoint is the average of it's two endpoints
  3. Move each original point to new point

    $$ \frac{F + 2R + (n-3)P}{n} $$
5. For all new vertex points, connect the edge points of all edges originally incident to that vertex
6. Define new faces enclosed as edges

## Anti-aliasing
- Naive anti-aliasing is to low pass filter the entire image at output
- Aliasing is most common in the following cases:
  - Regions of abrubt change in luminance, such as silhouetting of a surface
  - Objects too small to be consistently sampled
  - Sampled function (e.g. texture) is mapped onto a surface
- The visible surface algorithm performs LPF only in these regions

## Pixel Intensity Solving
- Also _WILD_
1. Every corner of every pixel is treated as a sample point
2. Intensities for all sample points is deduced
3. The radiance of the four points are compared
  - If nearly equal values and no small object lies in the center region, the average is assumed good enough, and finishes.
  - If one of the above does not hold, then...
4. The algorithm subdivides the sample square and starts over again
5. Repeat recursively until 
  - the computer "runs out of resolution"
  - Adequate detail within this sample square is achieved
6. The contribution of every region is weighted by it's area
7. All contributions are summed to produce the radiance of the pixel

- In the limit this is an area-sampling technique
- After this paper, they investigated the volumes contained by each set of corner rays
  - A containment test is applied for each volume

## Small Objects
- The bounding sphere of a small object is increased until it is guaranteed to be intersected by at least one ray
- If the ray passes within the minimum radius of a small object, but does _not_ intersect:
  1. All four sampling squares that share the ray are subdivided
  2. This continues until the object is intersected
- This may not work for reflection from curved surfaces
- This can be thought of analogously to ray pairs
