Simulation of Wrinkled Surfaces
James F. Blinn

# Abstract
- Surfaces at the time were extremely smooth
- Textures existed to attenuate reflection
  - but did not realistic for rough objects
- This paper perturbs the surface normal before lighting claculation

# Introduction

## Normals
- Surface Normal is important in calculation local intensity
- The partial derivates of point $P$ wrt vectors $u$ and $v$ are $Pu$ and $Pv$
- the normal is defined as

    $$ \overrightarrow{N} = \overrightarrow{P_u} \times \overrightarrow{P_v} $$

- the Normal must be scaled to a length of 1.0 by dividng by it's length

    $$ \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|} $$

## Texture Mapping
- Images of surfaces made from patches do not have arifacts like polygonal meshes
  - They can look too smooth
- Catmull's texturing mapping produces a 4th bivariate function $C(u,v)$
  - Where the other 3 are
  - $X = X(u,v)$
  - $Y = Y(u,v)$
  - $Z = Z(u,v)$
- This can be used to determine local intensity and vary over space
- Attempts to use texture mapping to simulate bumps and wrinkles had previously been unsuccesful
  - They looked like smooth objects with rough decals


# Normal Vector Perturbation
- Modelling each wrinkle a separate patch is prohibitively expensive
- This can modeled much more cheaply with surface normal perturbation


## Derivation
- On a wrinkled patch, the surface is displaced in the direction of the surface normal by an amount defined by $F(u,v)$

    $$ P' = P + F \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|} $$

- The new normal is solved similarly, only taking $P'$ into account

    $$ \overrightarrow{N'} = \overrightarrow{P'_{u}} \times \overrightarrow{P'_{v}} $$

- The partial derivates are solved with the chain rule

    $$ P'_u = \frac{d}{du} P' = \frac{d}{du}(P + F \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|}) $$
    $$ = P_u + F_u \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|} + F (\frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|})_u $$

    $$ P'_v = \frac{d}{dv} P' = \frac{d}{dv}(P + F \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|}) $$
    $$ = P_v + F_v \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|} + F (\frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|})_v $$

- The above is too complicated
  - We assume that F is small
  - For most renders F is between 0.01 and 0.1 so this isn't a terrible assumption

    $$ P'_u = P_u + F_u \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|} $$
    $$ P'_v = P_v + F_v \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|} $$

This all comes out to a calculation for the new normal:

    $$ N' = (P_u + F_u \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|}) 
       \times (P_v + F_v \frac{\overrightarrow{N}}{|N|}) 
    $$
    $$ = (P_u \times P_v) + F_u \frac{\overrightarrow{N} \times P_v}{|N|}
         + F_v \frac{P_v \times \overrightarrow{N} }{|N|} 
         + F_u F_v \frac{\overrightarrow{N} \times \overrightarrow{N}}{|N|}
    $$

## Simplification
- With some Simplifications
  - $ N := P_u \times P_v $
  - $ X \times X = 0 $

    $$ \overrightarrow{N'} = \overrightarrow{N} + \overrightarrow{D} $$
    $$ \overrightarrow{D} = \frac{F_u (\overrightarrow{N} \times P_v)
                          - F_v (\overrightarrow{N} \times P_u)}{|N|}
    $$

## Interpretation
- D lies on the tangent plane of the surface, with orthonormal bases
  - $ \overrightarrow{N} \times P_u $
  - $ \overrightarrow{N} \times P_v $
- The new $N'$ is just the existing normal and the addition of it's orthogonal space

- $N'$ can be passed on to the remaining intensity calculations after normalization

# Texture Function Definition
- How to calculate the texturing function $F$

## Possible Solutions
- Mentions checkerboard sampling
- Then bilinear interpolation
  - Bilinear interpolation is discontinuous in derivative
  - $F$ only appears in the normal calculation as it's derivative
  - So bilinear is a poor fit
- Thereby need a higher order filter to maintain continuouity in derivative (differentiability)
- Possible solution is B-Splines which are naturally 3rd order
  - Too General

## Implemented Solution
- Simplest solution is "differencing" (finding the derivative?) the bilerped function along the parametric directions ($u$ and $v$)
- For a texture of 64x64 

    $$ E = 1/64 $$
    $$ F_u = \frac{F(u+E, v) - F(u-E, v)}{2E} $$
    $$ F_v = \frac{F(u, v+E) - F(u, v-E)}{2E} $$

## Dealing with out-of-bounds
- Need to protect against indexing less than 0 or greater than 1

- Make the function periodic.
  - for 64x64 bits, $u = u \& 0x3F$ and $v = v \& 0x3F$

## Generating Bumps
- Algorithmically
- Letters using bitmap character
- Take z-buffers or depth-buffers from other renders
- Use a painting program

# Dependance on Scale
- Perturbation amount is not invariant with the scale of the object

## Variant Scaling
- If the $X$, $Y$, $Z$ surface definitions functions are scaled up by 2x
  - The normal vector length $|N|$ is 4x larger
  - The perturbation amount $|D|$ is only 2x larger
- This is because the object ($X$,$Y$,$Z$) is being scaled, but $F$ is _not_

## Invariant Scaling

    $$ D' = a D \frac{|N|}{|D|} $$
    $$ |D'| = a |N| $$
    $$ tan(\theta ') = \frac{|D'|}{|N|} = a $$
