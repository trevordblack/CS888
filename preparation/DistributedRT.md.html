Distributed Ray Tracing
Robert L. Cook, Thomas Porter, Loren Carpenter

# Abstract
- Ray Tracing makes many graphics techniques simple
  - shadows
  - reflections
  - refracted light
- Ray directions had previously been solved precisely
  - i.e. perfect reflections
- Solving for the ray direction by analytic function can yield new phenomena
  - Motion Blur
  - Depth of Field
  - Penumbras
  - Translucency
  - "fuzzy" reflections
- Previous motion blur and depth of field approaches were not an integrated solution
  - so there was inaccurate visibility

# Introduction
- If RT is done with proper anti-aliasing, the rays can sample
  - motion
  - the camera lens
  - the shading function
- Oversampling in space
- Sampling a specular distribution function produces gloss
- Sampling a transmission dist function produces translucency
- Sampling the solid angle of the light sources produces penumbra
  - Where a _solid angle_ is an $\omega$ of $\theta$ and $\phi$ terms
- Sampling the camera lens area produces depth of field
- Sampling in time produces motion blur

# Shading

The intensity $I$ of the reflected light at a point on a surface is

    $$I(\phi_r, \theta_r) = \int_{\phi_i} \int_{\theta_i}
        L(\phi_i, \theta_i) R(\phi_i, \theta_i, \phi_r, \theta_r)
        d \phi_i d \theta_i 
    $$
Where

- $(\theta_i,\phi_r)$ is the angle of incidence
- $(\theta_r,\phi_r)$ is the angle of reflection

The integration is simplified by some assumptions
- Assume that $L$ is a $\delta$ function ($L$ is zero except for lightpaths)
  - All light sources are treated as points
  - **No indirect lighting**
- Paths that are not in the direction of light sources have a single ambient term
  - The ambient light source is the same in all directions, s.t. $L$ is independent of $\phi_i$ and $\theta_i$
    - $L$ may be removed from the integral
- Assume that $R$ is a $\delta$ function ($R$ is a perfect mirror)
  - An associated assumption an be made for $T$

- Any shading function of value is going to be too complicated to solve for analytically
- We can still point sample it's value to create a Monte Carlo
  - This is done by distributing the rays
- The assumptions on $L$ and $R$ can be relaxed to model more complicated shading

## Gloss
- Reflections in real life are often blurred or hazy
- _Gloss_ represents how distinctly a surface reflects it's environment
- where _Gloss_ is typically [0,1]
  - _Roughness_ is usually represented as $1 - Gloss$
- Mirror reflections are rays traced in the _mirror_ direction

    $$ R_r = R_i - 2(N \cdot R_i)N $$

- Gloss can be created by distributing the rays around this direction

## Translucency
- Transmission is similar to reflection except 
  - $R$ is replaced by a $T$
  - The integral is performed over the hemisphere under the surface
- Transmitted light can have ambient, diffuse, and specular components
  - Unsurprising, but _are you fucking kidding me_
- Translucency is the gloss analog of transmission
  - i.e.  it is the specular component

## Penumbras
- Show up when a light source is partially obscured
- The reflected intensity is proportional to the solid angle of the visible portion of the light
- Determining the amount of solid angle visible is extremely complex to determine analytically

- Shadows are found by tracing rays from a surface toward the light sources
- Penumbras are found by distributing these rays
  - They can be traced to any point on the light source
- Light sources are no longer simplified as point sources

- The distribution of shadow rays must (says _must_ is actually _should_) be weighted according to 
  - the projected area of the light source (from the surface point)
  - the brightness of different parts of the light source (from the surface point)
- The number of rays traced toward a portion of the light _must_ be
  - proportional to the amount of the light's energy from that portion, if
  - the light was completely unobscured to the surface point

- The amount of light visible to any surface point is _then_ equal to the proportion of all light's intensity visible to that surface point

So, from a surface point, for every light:
1. Get the projected angle of that light source at the surface point
2. Determine the light intensity over solid angle (assuming no obscuring)
3. Sample shadow rays from this distribution

This can also be done one step up.
From every surface point
1. Determine the light intensity at the surface point for every light source in the scene (assuming no obscuring)
2. Determine the total intensity from all light sources
3. Determine a PDF for each light source by dividing it's intenstiy by the total
4. Choose a light source according to PDF
5. For every light
  1. Get the projected angle of that light source at the surface point
  2. Determine the light intensity over solid angle (assuming no obscuring)
  3. Sample shadow rays from this distribution


### Question
- What happens if the no obscuring assumption is dropped?
  - Don't we want to sample according to the real intensity of a light, rather than it's expected
- Should we sample 1 shadow ray for any given light, before sampling M lights from the pdf again. OR should we sample N shadow rays for a light, before going back to M lights in the PDF. What are reasonable values for M, N

# Depth of Field
- Previous computer gfx rendering had been modeling pin-hole cameras
- Potmesil simulated depth of field with a postprocessing technique
  - This cannot be fully accurate
  - Due to different parts of the lens having different visibility of the center

- In real life, cameras and the human eye have a finite lens
  - All points in a scene appear as a circle on the image plane
- The circle a point makes on the lens is called the _circle of confusion_
  - it's size depends on the distance to the point and the lens optics

## TODO


# Motion Blur
- Previous attempts at motion blur separated visibility from motion blur calculation
  - This is akin to sampling a still frame and then blurring the result

- In the example of a spinning top, the shadow of the top should not be blurred
  - even though the top's shading should be blurred
- Correctly blurring shadows requires multiple shades per frame

- The notion of an anlytic solution to motion-blur is abandoned
- Only distributing the samples in time can solve for accurate motion blur

# Other Implications of the Algorithm
- Visible surface calculation is easy
  1. Update the positions of the objects for that ray's time
  2. Send a ray from the lens to the sample point
  3. Find the object it intersects

- Properly bounding moving objects is a nontrival problem

- Volumes can be simulated by scaling with a $\tau$ over distance

# Summary Algorithm
- Intensity of a pixel is an analytic function over several nested integrals
  - over time
  - over the pixel region
  - over the lens area
  - reflection times illuminace over reflection hemisphere
  - transmittance times illuminace over transmitted hemisphere
  - The above is recursed
- Even for all of this complexity, point-sampling is still adequate
- If a function depends on $n$ parameters
  - simply sample over the $n$ dimensions
  - try to sample over the $n$ dimensions _well_

# Conclusions
- Solves a number of unsolved or partially solved problems
- Depth of Field calculations
- Blurry phenomena such as
  - penumbra
  - gloss
  - translucency
- Where all of that can be motion blurred
