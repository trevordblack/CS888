The rendering equation is so called because it encapsulated the set of all previously understood rendering techniques. The paper, and the equation, represent the mathematical simplification of previous techniques. The paper explains how previous rendering techniques were assumptive approximations of this one single equation. All previous rendering techniques were in one or another an attempt to model how photons (light) will scatter off of an arbitrary surface. The rendering equation states that the illumination at a point can be computed as the sum of illumination from all other points in the scene. Where the illumination from one point to another is completely defined by the emittance and the sum of reflected light scaled by the effect of the scene geometry. This definition is recursive. Removing one or more of the above (emittance, scattering, geometry, recursion) leads to the derivation of previous rendering techniques.
